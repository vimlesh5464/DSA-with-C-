# Meeting Rooms.py - Python skeleton converted from C++

# Original C++ code:
# // Given a 2D array arr[][], where arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.
# 
# // Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.
# 
# // Examples:
# 
# // Input: arr[][] = [[1, 4], [10, 15], [7, 10]]
# // Output: true
# // Explanation: Since all the meetings are held at different times, it is possible to attend all the meetings.
# 
# // Input: arr[][] = [[2, 4], [9, 12], [6, 10]]
# // Output: false
# // Explanation: Since the second and third meeting overlap, a person cannot attend all the meetings.
# 
# // Constraints:
# // 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
# // 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 2*106
# 
# #include <iostream>
# #include<vector>
# using namespace std;
# class Solution {
#   public:
#     bool canAttend(vector<vector<int>> &arr) {
#         // Code Here
#          // Sort meetings by start time
#         sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
#         
#         // Check for overlap
#         for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
#             if (arr[i][0] < arr[i-1][1]) {
#                 return false;
#             }
#         }
#         return true;
#     }
# };
